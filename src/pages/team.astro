                    <h3>Seb</h3>
                    <p><strong>Art, Design & Client Training</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Seb is responsible for the visual direction and design across both our games and software projects. His role includes concept art, asset styling, UI layout, and overall visual consistency. He also helps with design planning, like level structure and user flow.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the software side, Seb handles client training. He makes sure users know how to navigate and use the tools we deliver, whether it's a web dashboard or a custom-built system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Seb also contributes during playtesting and design review sessions, helping spot areas where visual communication or layout can be improved. His input often helps translate raw mechanics into something readable, playable, and more satisfying.

                    <h3>Scott</h3>
                    <p><strong>Audio & Gameplay</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Scott takes the lead on developing crucial systems early and effectively. He researches untested ideas, builds early test cases, and pushes into unfamiliar territory to see what's possible before it reaches production.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He focuses on rapid prototyping and proof of concept, allowing us to trial and evaluate new directions quickly. Whether it's building networked systems or proximity chat, Scott lays the groundwork so the rest of the team can iterate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to gameplay, Scott also handles implementation of dynamic audio, including sound effects, spatial cues, and reactive mixing, helping to shape the feel and responsiveness of each game moment.

                    <p>
                        Jordan handles core gameplay programming and the internal systems that keep our games and tools running smoothly. He manages backend infrastructure, builds and maintains web projects, and sets up pipelines that support development and deployment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of development, Jordan takes care of the day to day studio operations, including sales, client onboarding and invoicing, helping keep the business side moving while driving production forward.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He also supports long-term planning across projects, ensuring that what gets built today will still scale and function tomorrow. Whether it's code, documentation, or client work, Jordan keeps things structured and moving.
