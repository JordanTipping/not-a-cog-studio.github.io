          <h3>Branding Update</h3>
          <p class="news-date">June 10, 2025</p>
          <p>
            We have new branding. It's simple, clear, and fits what we're building here at Not A Cog. Thanks to Adam Locket for putting in the time to make it happen.

            We've just dropped a teaser trailer for our first game. It doesn't reveal the title, or even any mechanics, but it sets the tone for what's to come. Expect a darkly twisted mix of dark humour and sheer terror. We are deep in the lab, grinding away to bring this vision to life.
            <br /><br />
            The team are working super hard, and we felt like we wanted to say something, anything. We are saving the mechanics and the name reveal for later, but for now, we wanted to immerse you in the tone.
            <br /><br />
            We genuinely believe that this project is fresh, exciting, and something that we would love to play as gamers and not just devs.
            <br /><br />
            A full reveal is coming, but at the right time. For now, we keep working.
            <br /><br />
